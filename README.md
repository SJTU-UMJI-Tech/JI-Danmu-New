# JI-Danmu-New

A electron version of JI Live Danmu system.

## Feature

You should type each media file in a txt file in advance, and then drag them into the controller window.

**Notice that the first line in the txt file will be recognized as default video which will not be mentioned anywhere in the controller :).**

Here a default video will only load when no other video in queue, and dragging any single media file will not be perceived as default file.

After dragging a txt file, you can append other file into the queue.

You should explore other features by using and getting familiar with it :).



## Installation

-   Install `electron`
-   Install `cnpm`
-   Run `cnpm start`
